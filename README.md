# 🚀 Metrobi Senior Frontend Engineer - Technical Challenge

Dear Metrobi Team,

This project demonstrates my knowledge in modern React development, algorithm implementation, CSS animations, and creative problem-solving. I've designed each challenge to not only solve the technical requirements but also provide an engaging and polished user experience for the user.

I hope you enjoy exploring!

## 🎮 About This Challenge Application

This is an interactive React application featuring 7 unique coding challenges that test different aspects of frontend engineering:

1. **Array Duplicates** - Algorithm optimization and data structure manipulation
2. **Async Array Processing** - Promise handling and timing control
3. **Flexbox Layout** - Advanced CSS layout techniques
4. **Bracket Validator** - Stack-based algorithm implementation
5. **Egg Drop Problem** - Dynamic programming and optimization
6. **Zeno's Paradox Animation** - Complex animations and mathematical visualization
7. **Knapsack Problem** - Advanced algorithmic thinking

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 19** - Latest version with modern hooks and patterns
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development and build tool
- **SCSS** - Advanced styling with CSS preprocessing
- **Jest** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**

   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to explore the challenges!

### 🧪 Running Tests

To run the Jest test suite that validates the challenge implementations:

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (reruns on file changes)
npm run test:watch
```

The tests focus on the core algorithmic functions and logic, ensuring each challenge solution works correctly with various inputs and edge cases.
